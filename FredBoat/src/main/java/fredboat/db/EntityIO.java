/**
 * This class serves two main use cases - it allows wrapping database calls in a convenient and safe way through methods
 * like {@link EntityIO#doUserFriendly(NonnullSupplier)} and {@link EntityIO#onMainDb(NonnullFunction)}, and it is home
 * to commonly used methods to read entities without writing anything back, and writing entities without reading them
 * (in other words, operations not requiring transformations) that wrap these into the aforementioned convenience
 * methods, reducing the boilerplate code at all places which just need to read data from an entity, or just save data
 * into an entity.
 * The amount of functional things seen in here are higher then usual, therefore a look at exising usage is highly
 * recommended if finding oneself stuck at some point trying to figure out how to compose these methods, alternatively
 * you are invited to shout at Napster who wrote this code.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * How to use our database:
 * Our use cases can be roughly ordered into three categories:
 * 1. Read some data to act on it
 * Example: A track has started, we look up in the GuildConfig whether the guild wishes the bot to announce it
 * 2. Write some data
 * Example: A user has been autoblacklisted, we need to save his BlacklistEntry back to the database (which is otherwise
 * held in memory for performance reasons, so no need to read it first)
 * Another example: The prefix has been set, we need to save the new one to the database.
 * 3. Read some data, and depending on its contents write one thing, or another back, or maybe nothing at all
 * Example: Users setting up our permission system, where we want to give them feedback based on existing set up
 * permissions and maybe run a few checks, before adjusting the entity and saving it.
 * It is a lot better to do these lightweight (!) operations inside of an ongoing persistence context than
 * loading -> detaching -> saving, but managing the persistence context for each even so tiny query makes code both
 * verbose and error prone.
 * <p>
 * Use cases 1 & 2, especially when the entity is used across the bot, warrant a convenience getter method in this class.
 * Example: loading the GuildConfig, loading GuildPermissions
 * Use cases of type 3 usually have some unique logic to them, which is tied to the context they are called from. It is
 * probably better to keep that logic in the place wherever it is needed, and not bring it to this class.
 * <p>
 * If your use case is not covered by the above / Where the heck is the EntityManager / my query is too complicated for
 * this framework / I need to manage the persistence context for my query / I need to set weird JDBC/Hibernate
 * properties on the connection for my query:
 * The EntityManager can be grabbed and used this way:
 * <pre>
 *  doUserFriendly(onMainDb(
 *      wrapper -> {
 *          EntityManager em = wrapper.unwrap().getEntityManager();
 *          try {
 *              //your code here, returning something
 *          } catch (NastySqlExceptions and what not) {
 *              //probably rethrow as DatabaseException to be caught by doUserFriendly()
 *          } finally {
 *              em.close();
 *          }
 *      }
 *  ));
 * </pre>
 * Make sure to have a look at {@link space.npstr.sqlsauce.DatabaseWrapper} for more usage examples of the EntityManager.
