# FredBoat was written to work with PostgreSQL.
# If you are running with docker-compose then you don't need to change the jdbcUrl here.
# In PostgreSQL, role means user and vice versa. Keep that in mind when reading the following help and the provided links.
# If you are running your own PostgreSQL database, you will need to provide a role and a database belonging to that role.
# The role needs at least the permission to log in.
# All postgres databases used by FredBoat are required to have the Hstore extension enabled.
# Learn more about roles here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/database-roles.html
# Learn more about creating databases here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/manage-ag-createdb.html
# Learn more about the postgres jdbc url here: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html
# Learn more about creating extensions here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html
# If you are using an SSH tunnel, you need to point your jdbc url to localhost and the configured tunnelLocalPort
# Example jdbc: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/fredboat?user=fredboat&password=youshallnotpass"
jdbcUrl:           ""


# Ssh tunnel for a remote database. this is useful for when you don't want to expose your database on the remote server
# and instead use ssh tunneling to access it
# If you are running with docker-compose then you don't need to change any ssh value here.
# If you are using an SSH tunnel, you need to point your jdbc url to localhost and the configured tunnelLocalPort

# Database for caching things, see config of main database above for details about the individual values.
# If you are running with docker-compose then you don't need to change the cache jdbcUrl here.
# The main and cache databases can be two databases inside a single postgres instance.
# They CANNOT be the same database due to the way flyway migrations work.
# The main benefit is that you don't have to backup/migrate the cache database, it can just be dropped/recreated
# If you do not provide a jdbc url for the cache database, FredBoat will still work (most likely), but may have a degraded
# performance, especially in high usage environments and when using Spotify playlists.
# If you are going to use two different ssh tunnels for both database connections, make sure that the local tunnel ports don't collide

# Additional google keys
# If you find yourself running a big bot and hitting youtube API ratelimits, you can add several keys via the list below.
